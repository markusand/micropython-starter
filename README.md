# MicroPython Starter

This is a starter template for MicroPython projects to get up and running with MicroPython boards like ESP8266, ESP32, and STM32.

## Setup

Create a new repo from this template to get started. Set name and metadata from pyproject.toml and pymakr.conf for your project.

Add stubs for your platform (stm32, esp8266, etc.) to provide hints, auto-completion, and static type checking.

```bash
pip3 install -U micropython-{platform}-stubs --no-user --target ./typings
```
